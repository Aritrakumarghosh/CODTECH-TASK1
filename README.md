OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) ON TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION DATASET

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis(EDA) on a dataset containing name , age , ticket fare, cabin , gender, of passengers on the Titanic ship. The aim is to design a predictive model that draws graphs and charts , usig various mathematical modules of Python and gives an overall survival probability of male passengers and female passengers

KEY ACTIVITIES: 
Data Acquisition and Cleaning
Data Collected: The Titanic dataset was obtained from a reliable source.
Data Cleaned: The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.
Features Engineered: New features were created or existing ones were transformed to better represent the predictive power of the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Summaries Generated: Descriptive statistics were generated to understand the distribution of features.
Visualization Used: Plots (e.g., histograms, box plots) were used to visualize relationships between variables and identify patterns.

4. Modeling
Features Selected: Relevant features that contributed most to predicting survival were chosen.
Models Selected: Appropriate machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) were selected based on the nature of the problem (classification).
Models Trained: The selected models were trained on the training dataset.
Models Evaluated: Models were evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and techniques (e.g., cross-validation) to ensure robustness.

5. Model Deployment
Validation Set Tested: The final model was tested on a separate validation set to assess its performance.
Deployment Prepared: The model was prepared for deployment in a real-world scenario, considering factors like scalability and integration requirements.

6. Documentation and Presentation
Report Generated: The entire process, including data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling techniques used, and results obtained, was documented.
Results Visualized: Findings were presented through clear visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) and the modelâ€™s predictions were explained.
